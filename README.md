# Train_Scheduler
I have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates the information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
